This project is to create a calendar with choices for meals on each day.
Each user will select one meal on every day that the user wants to have a selected meal.
The user can return to the calendar to add, change, or delete meals.
The user must login to the app to be able to do functions on his/her calendar.
Each calendar will be saved in a database so a user can come back to it after leaving the app.
Off to the side of the calendar will be a list of ingredients to be bought that is from all meals chosen for the month.
We will not be putting in quantities of ingredients.  For example, if bacon and eggs is chosen 1 day or every day, the ingredients will     just say bacon, eggs
